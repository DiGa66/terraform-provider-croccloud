# Data Source: aws_route53_zone

`Provides information about a specific Route 53 hosted zone.

This data source allows to find a hosted zone ID given hosted zone name and certain search criteria.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how to get a hosted zone from its name and from this data how to create a record set.


```terraform
data "aws_route53_zone" "selected" {
  name         = "test.com."
  private_zone = true
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "www" {
  zone_id = data.aws_route53_zone.selected.zone_id
  name    = "www.${data.aws_route53_zone.selected.name}"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "300"
  records = ["10.0.0.1"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available
hosted zone. You have to use `zone_id` or `name`, not both of them. The given filter must match exactly one
hosted zone. If you use `name` field for private hosted zone, you need to add `private_zone` field to `true`

* `zone_id` - (Optional) The ID of the desired hosted zone.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the desired hosted zone.
* `private_zone` - (Optional) Used with `name` field to get a private hosted zone.
* `vpc_id` - (Optional) Used with `name` field to get a private hosted zone associated with the vpc_id (in this case, private_zone is not mandatory).
* `tags` - (Optional) Used with `name` field. Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired hosted zone.
