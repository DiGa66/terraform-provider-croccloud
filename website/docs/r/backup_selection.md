}

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "example" {
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.this.names[0]
  type              = "gp2"
  size              = 8
}

resource "aws_backup_plan" "example" {
  name = "tf-backup-plan"

  rule {
    rule_name         = "tf-backup-rule"
    target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault_default.example.name
    schedule          = "cron(0 12 * * *)"
    start_window      = 60
    completion_window = 180

    lifecycle {
      delete_after = 30
    }
  }

  rule {
    rule_name         = "tf-backup-rule2"
    target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault_default.example.name
    schedule          = "cron(0 23 * * *)"
    start_window      = 60
    completion_window = 180

      delete_after = 60
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_backup_selection" "example" {
  name    = "tf-backup-selection"
